This paper summarized possible metrics for measuring and comparing attributes of multi-document summarization corpora and systems, as proposed in the original paper. \cite{dey-etal-2020-corpora}

Based on these, possible alternatives were discussed and the status quo of metrics in MDS was outlined. The metrics were then calculated for the WCEP corpus.

Summarizing the above, the field of MDS is often not defined very clearly and therefore missing standard.
This is also true for dealing with biases, which are, if at all, mostly discussed qualitatively as a sort of disclaimer, but not usually quantified.
Future Research into standardizing corpora and metrics for MDS may be helpful to ensure a productive debate about bias in generated language and possible approaches to mitigating them.
