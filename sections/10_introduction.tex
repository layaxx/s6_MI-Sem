With the recent rise in popularity of large language models such as GPT3 or DALL-E,
and companies beginning to bridge the gap between research and commercial use,
it is important to keep in mind that such models may not be free of biases.
% TODO: Citations needed, also: should be longer


% TODO: here or in metrics section: state focus on corpus metrics as opposed to system metrics

This paper will focus on bias in both actual systems and underlying corpora of multi-document summarization (MDS) models.
MDS has use cases such as review or news aggregation, and as such biases can have noticeable impact.\cite{dey-etal-2020-corpora}
Starting from a 2020 paper\cite{dey-etal-2020-corpora} dealing with this topic,
the metrics for quantifying biases proposed in this paper as well as its impact and possible alternative criteria will be discussed.
