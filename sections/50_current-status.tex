% TODO: Off all recently published papers regarding multi-document summarization:
%   - how many mention biases at all?
%       - if mentioned: 
%           - what metrics are used?
%           - what are the results? Mitigation strategies?
%   - how many provide a custom corpus vs use a common one?

% Halluzinations?

% https://arxiv.org/pdf/2106.00829.pdf -> ConvoSumm
% Bias may be propagated

% https://paperswithcode.com/paper/a-large-scale-multi-document-summarization A Large-Scale Multi-Document Summarization Dataset from the Wikipedia Current Events Portal -> not mention of bias or metrics, available for download
