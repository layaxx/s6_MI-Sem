% TODO: Off all recently published papers regarding multi-document summarization:
%   - how many mention biases at all?
%       - if mentioned: 
%           - what metrics are used?
%           - what are the results? Mitigation strategies?
%   - how many provide a custom corpus vs use a common one?
