In this section, the status quo shall be outlined, i.e. how researchers, that propose MDS corpora handle bias and the overall quality of their dataset.

As previously stated, there is no widely accepted framework for this, leading to different approaches by different authors.
I have selected recent (published in 2020 or later) papers introducing MDS corpora, and will now show their approach to bias and comparability.
