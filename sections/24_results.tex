The authors apply their metrics to a range of corpora and MDS systems. Their main finding is that corpus used has a high impact on the the performance of each system.

This can be seen in \ref{results}, which ranks system performance as measured by ROUGE-1 for every corpus under consideration. For every dataset, a different MDS system performed best, as denoted by value 1 and blue color.

The only outlier is ICSI\_Summ, which managed to be the best-performing system on two separate corpora, but also achieved the worst ROUGE-1 rating on the DUC corpus and the third-worst on Opin.

% TODO: Maybe put reference to papers for datasets/systems?

Therefore, to make reliable statements about the capabilities of a MDS system,
it is not sufficient to just choose one dataset and report ROUGE scores for that. Instead, performance over multiple datasets should be considered and reported.
